I’m Bradley and this is my website. Woohoo! I’m a computer engineering student at the Rochester Institute of Technology, as well as an embedded systems software engineer and Co-Founder at [Case Wallet Inc] (http://choosecase.com). Case Wallet is a security company currently specializing in bitcoin technologies. Our first product, a secure and easy to use bitcoin wallet, shipped August 2015 and sold out quickly. At school I recently began my Master's research in Software Defined Radio (SDR) for reconfigurable hardware (FPGAs). I have a great passion for space and recently had the incredible opportunity to be a research associate at the NASA Langley Research Center. I am a member of the [R.I.T. Space Exploration
research group] (http://sites.sg.rit.edu/spex/) as well as the R.I.T. Heterogeneous Computing research group. I also like to do a lot of projects outside of school and work so this website will mostly be documenting them. Some of these projects include Arduino controlled L.E.D. strip Christmas lights, Raspberry Pi security camera, arcade controller, and this website! All of my code and whatever other documentation I use should also be [available on github]
