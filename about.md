I’m Bradley and this is my website. Woohoo! I’m a computer engineering student at the Rochester Institute of Technology, as well as an embedded systems software engineer and Co-Founder at [Case Wallet Inc] (http://choosecase.com). Case Wallet is a security company currently specializing in bitcoin technologies, producing  a secure and easy to use bitcoin wallet. I have a great passion for space and recently joined the [R.I.T. Space Exploration club] (http://sites.sg.rit.edu/spex/). I am very excited to start contributing to the various projects the club is pursuing. I also like to do a lot of projects outside of school and work so this website will mostly be documenting them. Some of these projects include arduino controlled L.E.D. strip christmas lights, raspberry pi security camera, arcade controller, and this website! All of my code and what ever other documentation I use should also be [available on github] (https://github.com/bec5030). 

## Future projects 
Nixie tube clock  
Piezo/bluetooth door lock sensor  
Laser engraver
