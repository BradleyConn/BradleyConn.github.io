I’m Bradley and this is my website. Woohoo! I’m a computer engineering student at the Rochester Institute of Technology, and work as an embedded systems software engineer at an [awesome new start-up company] (http://choosecase.com) making a secure, easy to use bitcoin wallet. I like to do a lot of projects outside of school and work so this website will mostly be documenting them. Some of these projects include arduino controlled L.E.D. strip christmas lights, raspberry pi security camera, arcade controller, and this website! All of my code and what ever other documentation I use should also be [available on github] (https://github.com/bec5030). 

## Future projects 
nixie tube clock  
piezo/bluetooth door lock sensor  
laser engraver  

## Open source projects I hope to someday contribute to
